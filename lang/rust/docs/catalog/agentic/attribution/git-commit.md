# Git Commit Attribution Baseline

Standard attribution format for AI-assisted git commits in the Fulmen ecosystem.

## Overview

AI-assisted commits require explicit attribution that captures:

| Element       | Purpose                              | Example                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Model**     | Which AI model generated the content | Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet, GPT-5.2 |
| **Interface** | Which agentic tool was used          | Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI          |
| **Role**      | What role the agent was operating as | devlead, secrev, entarch                |

This enables audit trails, debugging, and accountability.

## Supervised Mode Template

Human reviews and takes accountability before commit:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body - what and why>

Changes:
- <specific change 1>
- <specific change 2>
- <specific change 3>

Generated by <Model> via <Interface> under supervision of @<maintainer>

Co-Authored-By: <Model> <noreply@3leaps.net>
Role: <role>
Committer-of-Record: <Human Name> <email> [@maintainer]
```

### Example: Supervised Commit

```
feat(schema): add agent role definitions

Introduces role catalog with baseline prompts for development,
review, and infrastructure roles.

Changes:
- Add docs/catalog/agentic/roles/ directory structure
- Create devlead, devrev, infoarch role prompts
- Add README with usage patterns and customization guide

Role: entarch
Committer-of-Record: Dave Thompson <dave.thompson@3leaps.net> [@3leapsdave]
```

## Autonomous Mode Template

Agent operates independently within defined boundaries:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body - what and why>

Changes:
- <specific change 1>
- <specific change 2>

Generated by <Model> via <Interface> (autonomous)

Co-Authored-By: <Model> <noreply@3leaps.net>
Role: <role>
Autonomous-Agent: @<org>-agent-<role>
Escalation-Contact: @<maintainer>
```

### Example: Autonomous Commit

```
chore(deps): update dependencies

Weekly automated dependency update.

Changes:
- Update lodash 4.17.20 -> 4.17.21
- Update typescript 5.3.2 -> 5.3.3

Generated by Claude Sonnet via GitHub Actions (autonomous)

```

## Element Reference

### Model Names

Use the model's canonical name as provided by the vendor:

| Vendor    | Model             | Attribution Name |
| --------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Anthropic | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Claude Sonnet    |
| Anthropic | Claude Opus 4.5   | Claude Opus 4.5  |
| OpenAI    | GPT-4o            | GPT-4o           |
| OpenAI    | GPT-5.2           | GPT-5.2          |
| Google    | Gemini 2.0        | Gemini 2.0       |

### Interface Names

| Interface      | Attribution    | URL                             |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Claude Code    | Claude Code    | https://claude.com/claude-code  |
| Cursor         | Cursor         | https://cursor.sh/              |
| Codex CLI      | Codex CLI      | https://github.com/openai/codex |

| OpenCode       | OpenCode       | https://github.com/sst/opencode |

### Role Identifiers

Reference the role catalog for available roles:

| Role                  | Identifier | When to Use                                |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Development Lead      | `devlead`  | Implementation, architecture, feature work |
| Development Reviewer  | `devrev`   | Code review, bug finding, four-eyes audit  |
| Information Architect | `infoarch` | Documentation, schemas, standards          |
| Enterprise Architect  | `entarch`  | Cross-repo coordination, API parity        |
| CI/CD Automation      | `cicd`     | Pipelines, builds, automation              |
| Security Review       | `secrev`   | Security analysis, vulnerability review    |
| Data Engineering      | `dataeng`  | Database design, data pipelines            |

See [Role Catalog](../roles/README.md) for full role definitions.

## Trailer Order

Trailers MUST appear in this order:

**Supervised:**

```
Co-Authored-By: <Model> <noreply@3leaps.net>
Role: <role>
Committer-of-Record: <Human> <email> [@handle]
```

**Autonomous:**

```
Co-Authored-By: <Model> <noreply@3leaps.net>
Role: <role>
Autonomous-Agent: @<org>-agent-<role>
Escalation-Contact: @<maintainer>
```

## Distinguishing Modes

Reviewers can quickly identify operation mode:

| Trailer                       | Mode       | Accountability                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Committer-of-Record: @human` | Supervised | Named human                         |
| `Autonomous-Agent: @bot`      | Autonomous | Organization via escalation contact |

## Email Domain

All Fulmen ecosystem agent attributions use `noreply@3leaps.net`:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@3leaps.net>
```

Never use vendor-provided defaults:

- `noreply@anthropic.com`
- `noreply@openai.com`

## Changes Section

The `Changes:` section provides a scannable summary:

```
Changes:
- Add health handler in internal/server/handlers/
- Wire route in server.go
- Add tests with 95% coverage
```

Guidelines:

- Start each line with action verb (Add, Update, Fix, Remove, Refactor)
- Be specific enough for quick understanding
- 3-7 items is typical; more suggests commit should be split

## Four-Eyes Review Attribution

When one agent writes code and another reviews:

```
feat(api): add rate limiting middleware

Implements token bucket rate limiting with configurable limits.

Changes:
- Add ratelimit package with token bucket algorithm
- Wire middleware in server initialization
- Add integration tests

Generated by Claude Opus 4.5 via Claude Code under supervision of @3leapsdave

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@3leaps.net>
Role: devlead
Reviewed-By: GPT-5.2 (Role: devrev)
Committer-of-Record: Dave Thompson <dave.thompson@3leaps.net> [@3leapsdave]
```

The `Reviewed-By` trailer captures the reviewing agent and their role.

## Commit Message Length

| Section       | Limit    | Rationale                          |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Subject       | 50 chars | Git tooling, GitHub display        |
| Body lines    | 72 chars | Terminal display, diff readability |
| Changes items | 3-7      | Commit focus; more = split commit  |

## Quick Checklist

Before committing, verify:

- [ ] Subject line is imperative, <50 chars, no period
- [ ] Body explains what and why (not how)
- [ ] `Changes:` section has specific bullet points
- [ ] `Generated by` line has Model, Interface, supervisor
- [ ] `Co-Authored-By` uses `noreply@3leaps.net`
- [ ] `Role` matches the role you were operating as
- [ ] `Committer-of-Record` (supervised) or `Autonomous-Agent` + `Escalation-Contact` (autonomous)
- [ ] Trailers are in correct order
