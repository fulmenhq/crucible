# Initial Commit History Squash - October 7, 2025

## Context

During the initial setup and first push of the Crucible repository to GitHub, we identified licensing documentation inconsistencies that needed correction before making the repository public.

## Issue

The README.md and LICENSE files contained:

1. Detailed licensing descriptions in README that could conflict with LICENSE text
2. Incorrect repository link in LICENSE (pointed to fulmen-cosmography instead of crucible)
3. Missing OSS policies trailer section in README
4. Trademark claim on "Crucible" (common English word, should not be trademarked)
5. Styling inconsistencies in README footer (not matching "Start Fast. Thrive on Scale" tagline)

## Decision

Since the repository had not yet been made public and had zero external clones, we decided to squash the initial three commits into a single comprehensive v2025.10.0 release commit. This approach:

- Ensures clean history when repository goes public
- Prevents any possibility of old licensing text being accessible in history
- Simplifies the initial release to a single cohesive commit
- Avoids confusion from orphaned commits in reflog

## Original Commit History

Before squash (never made public):

1. `bb235df` - feat: add prepush, precommit, check-all targets to Makefile standard and implementation
2. `0bc2cbb` - feat: bootstrap Crucible repository with schemas and standards
3. `01b75a9` - fix: restore biome.json structure and repository code quality checks

## Action Taken

1. Reset HEAD to accumulate all changes from the three commits
2. Fixed LICENSE and README with proper trailers and trademark clarifications
3. Created single squashed commit: "feat: bootstrap Crucible repository with comprehensive schemas, standards, and tooling"
4. Recreated tag v2025.10.0 pointing to new commit
5. Force-pushed to GitHub with `--force-with-lease` to replace history

## Changes Made

**LICENSE updates:**

- Fixed repository link from fulmen-cosmography to crucible
- Removed "Crucible" from trademark claims (common English word)

**README updates:**

- Replaced detailed licensing description with simple link to LICENSE
- Added OSS Policies section with links to organization-wide policies
- Updated footer styling to match "Start Fast. Thrive on Scale" tagline
- Removed "Crucible" from trademark notices

**Provenance:**

- Created this memo in docs/ops/repository/ for audit trail
- Documented original commit SHAs for internal reference

## Validation

- All quality checks passed (make check-all)
- License scan confirmed safe dependencies (MIT, Apache-2.0, Python-2.0)
- Guardian approval obtained for force-push
- Tag v2025.10.0 successfully created and pushed

## Impact

- Zero external impact (repository was private, no clones existed)
- Clean public history when repository is made public
- Proper licensing documentation in place from day one
- Consistent with 3 Leaps OSS policies
