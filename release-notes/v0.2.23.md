# v0.2.23 Release Notes

## 🚀 Features

### Experimental: Enact (Initial Schema Support)

Crucible now includes initial, **experimental** schema support for **Enact** — a guided, imperative, idempotent deployment model.

- Schema suite: `schemas/enact/v1.0.0/`
- Supporting docs: `docs/architecture/enact/`
- Example instances: `examples/enact/v1.0.0/`

Further Enact schema and validation updates will follow in subsequent releases.

## 🛠️ Fixes & Improvements

- **Schema validation**: all schemas continue to pass meta-validation and existing semantic checks.
- **Version synchronization**: consistent version `0.2.23` across manifests and generated artifacts.
