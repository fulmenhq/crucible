# Release v0.4.11

**Role catalog schema compliance and 3leaps/crucible v0.1.8 upstream sync.**

## Overview

This release updates all FulmenHQ agentic roles to comply with the enhanced role-prompt schema from 3leaps/crucible v0.1.8, which now requires the `domains` property for business-process organization. Also includes latest upstream sync with formatted schemas and governance role enhancements. Minimum goneat v0.5.3 now required for JSON Schema 2019-09 support.

## Highlights

### Schema Compliance - All 11 Roles Updated

Every agentic role in `config/agentic/roles/` now includes the `domains` property required by the updated role-prompt schema:

| Role       | Domains                            | Purpose              |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `cicd`     | automation, delivery               | Pipeline automation  |
| `dataeng`  | development, analytics             | Data pipelines       |
| `devlead`  | development, implementation        | Implementation lead  |
| `devrev`   | development, quality               | Code review          |
| `entarch`  | governance, architecture, strategy | Ecosystem governance |
| `infoarch` | development, documentation         | Schema & docs        |
| `prodmktg` | delivery, marketing                | Product marketing    |
| `qa`       | development, quality               | Testing & validation |
| `releng`   | delivery, development              | Release coordination |
| `secrev`   | development, security              | Security review      |
| `uxdev`    | development, implementation        | Frontend development |

### Upstream Sync - 3leaps/crucible v0.1.8

Pulled 28 files from upstream with these notable changes:

- **Formatted schemas**: All JSON schema files reformatted for consistency (inline enums expanded)
- **Role-prompt schema v0.1.8**: Now requires `domains` property (array of 1-3 domain enums)
- **New upstream roles** (not synced to roles/, tracked in schemas/):
  - `deliverylead` - Project coordination (sprint-quarter timeline)
  - `cxotech` - Strategic governance (6-18mo timeline)
- **Three-tier governance model**: dispatch → deliverylead → cxotech
- **Tooling requirement**: Minimum goneat v0.5.3 for JSON Schema 2019-09 support

### Process Domain Framework

The new `domains` property enables business-process organization across the role catalog:

**15 process domains defined**:

- development, implementation, quality, security
- delivery, marketing, analytics
- governance, architecture, strategy, coordination
- automation, documentation, product

## Breaking Changes

**None for consumers.** This is a compliance release - all changes are additive:

- Schema gains new optional field that is now required for validation
- All existing roles updated to include the new required field
- No API or behavior changes

## Migration Guide

**For downstream repositories using FulmenHQ schemas**:

1. Update role definitions to include `domains` property:

   ```yaml
   domains:
     - development
     - implementation
   ```

2. Valid domain values (choose 1-3):
   - analytics, architecture, automation, consulting
   - coordination, delivery, development, documentation
   - governance, implementation, marketing, product
   - quality, security, strategy

3. Run validation: `make lint-config`
