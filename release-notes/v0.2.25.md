# v0.2.25 Release Notes

## 🛠️ Fixes & Improvements

### README Accuracy and CI Badges

- Fixed GitHub Actions badges to reference the current workflow files under `.github/workflows/`.
- Updated README examples and links to match the current repository structure and exported APIs.

### Goneat Hooks and Bootstrap

- Switched `.goneat/hooks.yaml` to run `goneat assess` directly (prevents make-based hook loops).
- Updated `make bootstrap` to install `goneat` globally via `sfetch --install` (pinned to `v0.3.21` by default).

### Version Synchronization

- Bumped to `0.2.25` across manifests and generated artifacts.
