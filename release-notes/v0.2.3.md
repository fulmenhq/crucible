## What's New

### Documentation Navigation Improvements

Added comprehensive README files to previously missing documentation directories:

#### 1. `docs/guides/README.md`

**Purpose**: Index of practical integration and development guides

**Features**:

- Overview of all available guides
- "When to use" guidance for each guide
- Quick reference by task (integrating, bootstrapping, creating libraries)
- Quick reference by role (application developer, library maintainer, Crucible maintainer)
- Cross-references to related architecture and standards

**Coverage**:

- Integration Guide (production & development patterns)
- Bootstrap goneat (setup and configuration)
- Fulmen Library Bootstrap Guide (creating helper libraries)

---

#### 2. `docs/architecture/README.md`

**Purpose**: Overview of architectural documentation with navigation aids

**Features**:

- Categorized architecture documents:
  - Ecosystem Foundation (manifesto, ecosystem guide)
  - Repository & Sync Architecture (pseudo-monorepo, sync model, library ecosystem)
  - Library Standards (helper library standard, Forge Workhorse standard)
- Recent significant ADRs highlighted
- Quick reference by topic and role
- When to read guidance for each document
- Cross-references to standards, guides, and operations

**Navigation by Role**:

- Crucible Maintainer path
- Library Developer path
- Application Developer path
- New to Fulmen onboarding path

#### 3. `docs/architecture/decisions/README.md`

**Purpose**: Complete ADR index with rich metadata

**Features**:

- **Complete ADR Index**: All 10 ecosystem ADRs indexed with:
  - Status (Accepted, Proposed, Superseded, etc.)
  - Date
  - Summary
  - Impact statement
  - Key decisions
  - Related ADRs and documentation
- **Categorized by Topic**:
  - Versioning & Repository Structure (ADR-0009, ADR-0010)
  - Telemetry & Observability (ADR-0007, ADR-0008)
  - Data Modeling & Configuration (ADR-0003, ADR-0004, ADR-0005, ADR-0006)
  - Catalog & Data Management (ADR-0002)
  - Governance (ADR-0001)
- **ADR Guidelines**:
  - When to create an ADR
  - What makes a good ADR
  - Creation process
- **ADR States**: Explained (Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, Deprecated, Rejected)

**Value**: Newcomers can quickly understand architectural decisions without reading all ADRs. Each summary provides context, impact, and pointers to related documentation.

**Purpose**: Operations documentation specific to Crucible repository

**Features**:

- Repository operations checklists:
  - Pre-commit checklist
  - Pre-release checklist
