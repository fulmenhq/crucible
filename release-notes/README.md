# Crucible Release Notes

This directory houses per-release notes for Crucible using CalVer (`YYYY.MM.REVISION`).

## Workflow

- For each release, create a new Markdown file named `<calver>.md` (for example, `2025.10.2.md`).
- Populate the file with a brief summary, highlights, and any migration or validation reminders.
- Keep detailed ongoing work in `CHANGELOG.md`; release notes should stay concise and link back to the
  changelog entry when applicable.
- As part of the release checklist, add a final step to generate the new release notes file before tagging.
