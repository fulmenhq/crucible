# v0.4.8 - Process Fix

Fixes sync process gap from v0.4.7 release.

## Fixed

- **Biome Schema**: Updated to 2.3.10 (was 2.3.2)
- **Precommit Sync**: Added `sync-to-lang` as explicit dependency of `precommit` target
  - v0.4.7 tag was missing `qa.yaml` in `lang/*/config/` due to sync running after tagging
  - Now ensures lang directories are current before any commit
