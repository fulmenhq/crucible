# Release Notes: 2025.10.2

**Date:** 2025-10-17

This release substantially expands Crucible's standards documentation with ecosystem architecture guidance, enhanced coding standards across all languages, progressive logging infrastructure, and operational workflow improvements.

## Highlights

- **Ecosystem Documentation**: Added comprehensive architecture guides (fulmen-ecosystem-guide.md, fulmen-technical-manifesto.md) documenting FulmenHQ history, technical philosophy, and cross-repository standards alignment
- **Enhanced Coding Standards**: Expanded Go, Python, and TypeScript standards with schema-driven configuration hydration patterns (ยง3.4-3.5) and schema contract fixture testing requirements (ยง5.4-5.5)
- **Progressive Logging Framework**: Introduced profile-based logging policies with environment-specific defaults, middleware integration patterns, and comprehensive observability schemas
- **Operational Workflow**: Added commit message style guidelines and Crucible-specific workflow checklists documenting SSOT synchronization requirements for language wrapper maintenance
- **Foundry Catalog**: Promoted Foundry patterns to core module status with expanded validation coverage for HTTP status codes, MIME types, and country codes
- **Repository Lifecycle**: Standardized quality gating with lifecycle phase schemas supporting experimental through LTS maturity tracking

## For Downstream Consumers

Library maintainers (gofulmen, tsfulmen, pyfulmen) should note:

- New `#commit-message-style` anchor available in synced repository-operations-sop.md for cross-linking
- Schema-driven config hydration patterns now standardized across all language implementations
- Progressive logging profiles provide environment-specific defaults for development through production deployments

## Technical Improvements

- Biome formatting integrated into make fmt for consistent TypeScript schema formatting post-sync
- Bootstrap symlink creation fixed for type:link tools (was copying instead of symlinking, causing stale binaries)
- Assessment severity and security policy schemas added for goneat quality gate integration

For detailed changes, see the corresponding section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
