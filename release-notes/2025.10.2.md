# Release Notes: 2025.10.2

**Date:** 2025-10-22

This release substantially expands Crucible's standards documentation with ecosystem architecture guidance, enhanced coding standards across all languages, progressive logging infrastructure, Foundry catalog patterns, docscribe module, and operational workflow improvements.

## Highlights

- **Ecosystem Documentation**: Added comprehensive architecture guides (fulmen-ecosystem-guide.md, fulmen-technical-manifesto.md) documenting FulmenHQ history, technical philosophy, and cross-repository standards alignment
- **Enhanced Coding Standards**: Expanded Go, Python, and TypeScript standards with schema-driven configuration hydration patterns (ยง3.4-3.5) and schema contract fixture testing requirements (ยง5.4-5.5)
- **Progressive Logging Framework**: Introduced profile-based logging policies with environment-specific defaults, middleware integration patterns, and comprehensive observability schemas
- **Foundry Catalog Enhancements**: Added text similarity and normalization standard with case-insensitive lookups, alpha-2/alpha-3/numeric country code normalization, and precomputed secondary indexes for performance
- **Docscribe Module**: New standard for accessing and processing Crucible documentation assets with frontmatter extraction, header detection, and outline generation
- **Helper Library Standards**: Added Crucible Overview requirement and README version section requirement for consistent documentation across all language foundations
- **Operational Workflow**: Added commit message style guidelines and Crucible-specific workflow checklists documenting SSOT synchronization requirements for language wrapper maintenance
- **Repository Lifecycle**: Standardized quality gating with lifecycle phase schemas supporting experimental through LTS maturity tracking

## For Downstream Consumers

Library maintainers (gofulmen, tsfulmen, pyfulmen) should note:

- **Crucible Overview Requirement**: All helper library overview documents MUST now include a "Crucible Overview" section explaining what Crucible is, why shim/docscribe modules matter, and where to learn more
- **README Version Section**: Helper library READMEs MUST include a "Crucible Version" section showing how to access embedded version via CrucibleVersion() API
- **Metadata Contract**: CrucibleVersion() API contract defined (version, commit, dirty, syncedAt, syncMethod) with schema ownership deferred to goneat
- **Docscribe Integration**: New standard for frontmatter extraction and document processing available for library implementation
- **Foundry Text Patterns**: Text similarity and normalization patterns available with case-insensitive lookups and country code normalization
- New `#commit-message-style` anchor available in synced repository-operations-sop.md for cross-linking
- Schema-driven config hydration patterns now standardized across all language implementations
- Progressive logging profiles provide environment-specific defaults for development through production deployments

## Technical Improvements

- Biome formatting integrated into make fmt for consistent TypeScript schema formatting post-sync
- Bootstrap symlink creation fixed for type:link tools (was copying instead of symlinking, causing stale binaries)
- Format-before-sync order fixed to eliminate double-formatting and reduce synchronization noise
- Assessment severity and security policy schemas added for goneat quality gate integration
- Crucible-shim standard stabilized with enhanced API specifications

## Breaking Changes

None. All additions are backward-compatible requirements for new helper library features.
