# v0.4.7 - Quality Assurance Role

Adds a new `qa` agentic role for testing, validation, and quality gate enforcement across the Fulmen layer cake.

## Highlights

- **Layer-Cake Validation**: Schema conformance, cross-language parity, CRDL workflow testing
- **Coverage Targets**: Go ≥95%, TypeScript ≥85%, Python ≥90%
- **Fixture-First Testing**: Real execution over mocks, container-based fixtures
- **Dogfooding Workflows**: Acceptance testing patterns with detailed findings templates

## Added

- **Quality Assurance Role** (`config/agentic/roles/qa.yaml`)
  - Scope: test design, edge cases, quality gates, regression testing
  - Layer cake validation: SSOT conformance, library parity, template CRDL
  - Enterprise validation: API contracts, AAA, observability
  - Operational QA: dogfooding, performance baselines, fixture management
  - Mindset: "What could go wrong?", "Would this test catch a regression?"
  - Quality bars with language-specific coverage targets
  - Example findings templates for dogfooding and parity testing

## Impact

- **Helper library teams**: QA role validates cross-language parity
- **Fixture maintainers**: QA validates scenario coverage
- **Release process**: QA escalates quality gate failures blocking release
