# v0.2.26 Release Notes

## 🔐 Release Signing (New)

- Added a first-class, repeatable **signed release tag** workflow for Crucible releases:
  - `make release-tag` (GPG-signed annotated tag)
  - `make release-verify-tag` (local verification)
  - `make release-guard-tag-version` (VERSION/tag match guard)
- Optional: minisign sidecar attestation for the git tag object/target (publishable as GitHub Release assets).
- Optional: GitHub API verification helper (`make release-verify-remote-tag`) to check GitHub’s `.verification` view of the tag.

## 🔢 Version Synchronization

- Bumped to `0.2.26` across manifests and generated artifacts.
