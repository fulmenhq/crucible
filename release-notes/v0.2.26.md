# v0.2.26 Release Notes

## 📦 Repository Taxonomy Expansion

### New Repository Categories

- **spec-host**: Machine-first specification artifact hosting for published schemas, standards, and configuration files. Designed for automated consumption via HTTP/HTTPS with predictable URL structures.
- **missive**: Single-page promotional or call-to-action sites (landing pages, campaign microsites, waitlists).

### Spec Publishing Standard

- New `docs/standards/publishing/spec-publishing.md` defining requirements for spec-host repositories.
- Added `schemas/standards/publishing/v1.0.0/spec-catalog.schema.json` for optional `index.json` catalog format.
- Category-specific requirements in `docs/standards/repository-category/spec-host/` and `docs/standards/repository-category/missive/`.

### Codex Standard Clarification

- Reframed "Codex Registry" terminology to "Codex Spec Browser" throughout documentation.
- Added explicit clarification that Codex is human-first (browsing/discovery) while spec-host is machine-first (automated consumption).

## 🔐 Release Signing

- Added a first-class, repeatable **signed release tag** workflow for Crucible releases:
  - `make release-tag` (GPG-signed annotated tag)
  - `make release-verify-tag` (local verification)
  - `make release-guard-tag-version` (VERSION/tag match guard)
- Optional: minisign sidecar attestation for the git tag object/target (publishable as GitHub Release assets).
- Optional: GitHub API verification helper (`make release-verify-remote-tag`) to check GitHub's `.verification` view of the tag.

## 🛠️ Fixes & Improvements

- Fixed YAML workflow files to remove extraneous document separators.
- Fixed trailing newlines in release scripts.
- Updated ecosystem guide to be version-scheme-agnostic (removed CalVer-specific language).

## 🔢 Version Synchronization

- Bumped to `0.2.26` across manifests and generated artifacts.
