# Release Notes: 2025.10.3

**Date:** 2025-10-28

This release establishes Crucible as production-ready for public consumption with SSOT provenance tracking, expanded similarity metrics, comprehensive forge standards, and standardized tooling workflows.

## Highlights

- **SSOT Provenance Tracking**: Production-ready schema for tracking sync operations across the ecosystem with full audit trails, enabling reproducibility and dependency verification
- **Foundry Similarity v2.0.0**: Production similarity engine with 5 metrics (Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein OSA/Unrestricted, Jaro-Winkler, Substring), normalization presets, and 43 validated test fixtures
- **FulHash Module**: Enterprise-grade hashing standard with xxh3-128 (fast) and sha256 (secure) algorithms supporting both block and streaming operations
- **Forge Binary Naming Standard**: Opinionated naming convention ensuring clean template refit workflows across all language implementations
- **Standardized Tooling**: Unified goneat v0.3.2 bootstrap workflow with GitHub releases eliminates local development friction

## For Downstream Consumers

### SSOT Sync Consumers (All Repositories)

**SSOT Provenance Schema** (`schemas/content/ssot-provenance/v1.0.0/`) provides audit trail metadata for all SSOT sync operations:

- **What**: Provenance files document which SSOT sources were synced, from where, at what version/commit, and whether dirty
- **Where**: Consumed by helper libraries to expose version information via APIs (e.g., `crucible.GetProvenance()`)
- **Impact**: CI/CD pipelines can validate SSOT versions, detect dirty syncs, and ensure reproducible builds

### Helper Library Maintainers (gofulmen, tsfulmen, pyfulmen)

**FulHash Module Standard** available for implementation:

- **xxh3-128**: Default algorithm for fast content hashing (checksums, cache keys, content addressing)
- **sha256**: Secure algorithm for cryptographic requirements (integrity verification, security-sensitive operations)
- **APIs**: Block hashing for small data, streaming hashing for large files (O(1) memory)
- **Pathfinder Integration**: Optional checksum calculation during file discovery operations

**Foundry Similarity v2.0.0** ready for production use:

- **Metrics**: Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein (OSA/Unrestricted), Jaro-Winkler, Substring scoring
- **Normalization**: None, minimal, default, aggressive presets for consistent text comparison
- **Fixtures**: 43 validated test cases ensure cross-language implementation consistency
- **Suggestions**: Enhanced API with matched ranges, normalization tracking, and reason codes

**Telemetry Coordination**: Pre-implementation taxonomy coordination process documented in `docs/sop/libraries/module-telemetry-coordination.md` prevents schema validation failures during module implementation.

### Forge Template Developers

**Workhorse Binary Naming Convention** (`docs/architecture/fulmen-forge-workhorse-standard.md`):

- **Rule**: Binary names use breed identifier only (e.g., `groningen`, `percheron`), not `workhorse-{breed}`
- **Rationale**: Templates model final usage where users rename to their app name (e.g., `myapi`)
- **Impact**: Clean CDRL refit workflow with single refactoring pass for binary/env var/config renaming
- **Cross-Language**: Go and Python implementations follow identical naming conventions

## Technical Improvements

**Goneat v0.3.2 Integration**:

- Bootstrap workflow standardized using GitHub releases (tools.yaml)
- Fresh `make clean && make bootstrap` cycle downloads latest stable version
- Git hooks automatically discover goneat in `bin/` directory
- No more local symlink management or version drift

**Schema Versioning Pattern**:

- Foundry Similarity v2.0.0 establishes versioned schema directories pattern
- v1.0.0 preserved for historical reference, v2.0.0 active for new implementations
- Breaking changes managed through explicit version paths, not schema rewrites

**Metrics Taxonomy Expansion**:

- Added config_load_errors, pathfinder_find_ms, pathfinder_validation_errors, pathfinder_security_warnings
- Unblocks gofulmen Phase 3 telemetry implementation
- Coordination SOP prevents future implementation friction

## Breaking Changes

None. All additions are opt-in for new features or forward-compatible schema additions.

## Migration Guide

### For SSOT Sync Tool Maintainers (e.g., goneat)

Update provenance generation to reference new Crucible canonical location:

```yaml
schema:
  name: goneat.ssot.provenance
  version: v1
  url: https://github.com/fulmenhq/crucible/schemas/content/ssot-provenance/v1.0.0/ssot-provenance.schema.json
```

### For Helper Libraries Using Foundry Similarity v1.0.0

No action required. v1.0.0 remains supported. To adopt v2.0.0:

1. Update schema imports to `schemas/library/foundry/v2.0.0/similarity.schema.json`
2. Implement new metrics (Damerau-Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler, Substring) as needed
3. Add normalization preset support
4. Validate against v2.0.0 fixtures (43 test cases)

### For Workhorse Forge Implementations

Update binary naming to follow breed-name-only convention:

- **Binary**: Change from `workhorse-groningen` to `groningen`
- **Env Vars**: Change from `WORKHORSE_GRONINGEN_*` to `GRONINGEN_*`
- **Config Files**: Change from `workhorse-groningen.yaml` to `groningen.yaml`
- **Module Names**: Follow language conventions while using breed identifier
