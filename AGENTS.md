# Crucible â€“ AI Agents Startup Guide

## ðŸ”‘ Read First

- **Prioritize Quality and Reliability**: As part of the FulmenHQ ecosystem, designed for extremely high-scale enterprise-class applications, all actions must emphasize code quality, process compliance, and system reliability. Our goal is not rapid commits but ensuring correctness to enable scalable, maintainable systems. Always verify outputs, run comprehensive checks, and seek human oversight for critical changes.
- Confirm your agentic interface. If the session does not name an interface adapter (e.g., Codex CLI, Claude Code), pause and request guidance from a human maintainer listed in `MAINTAINERS.md` before taking action.
- Do not assume an agentic identity. Agent identities are assigned in `MAINTAINERS.md`. Request assignment if none is provided.
- Review `REPOSITORY_SAFETY_PROTOCOLS.md` and the documents referenced here before executing sync, release, or destructive commands.

### Known Interface Adapters

| Agentic Interface | Definitive Prompt / Rules File                       | Attribution Format                                                                                                  |

| Claude Code       | `CLAUDE.md` (if present) or `AGENTS.md`              | `Generated by <agent identity> ([Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)) under supervision of @3leapsdave`            |
| Cursor            | `AGENTS.md`                                          | `Generated by <agent identity> ([Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)) under supervision of @3leapsdave`                     |
| Cline             | `.cline/rules/PROJECT.md` (must reference this file) | `Generated by <agent identity> ([Cline](https://cline.bot/)) under supervision of @3leapsdave`                      |
| KiloCode          | `AGENTS.md`                                          | `Generated by <agent identity> ([KiloCode](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode)) under supervision of @3leapsdave` |
| OpenCode          | `AGENTS.md`                                          | `Generated by <agent identity> ([OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode)) under supervision of @3leapsdave`      |

Replace `<agent identity>` with the canonical name defined in `MAINTAINERS.md` (e.g., `Schema Cartographer`).

**Project**: crucible  
**Purpose**: Standards & schema SSOT for FulmenHQ â€“ Ensuring world-class information architecture, DevOps, and CI/CD practices for reliable, scalable enterprise applications.  
**Governance**: 3leaps Initiative

## Agent Identities

Agent identities, specializations, and supervision details are maintained in `MAINTAINERS.md`. Refer to that file for the current roster of AI co-maintainers.

## Session Startup Protocol

1. **Context Review**
   - Read `MAINTAINERS.md`, `REPOSITORY_SAFETY_PROTOCOLS.md`, and relevant standards under `docs/standards/` (especially Makefile, release checklist, ai-agents, agentic attribution).
2. **Environment Check**
   - Confirm required tools (`bun >= 1.2`, `go >= 1.21`) are available if commands will be executed.
3. **Plan**
   - Outline steps in `.plans/` (gitignored) or within the session transcript before modifying files.
4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Run `make check-all` or equivalent quality gates before committing. Analyze outputs thoroughly; do not proceed if checks fail. Prioritize fixing process issues over code changes.
5. **Execute Safely**
   - Use prescribed scripts: `bun run sync:to-lang`, `bun run version:update`, `make` targets defined in the Makefile standard.
6. **Attribution**
   - Follow [Agentic Attribution Standard](docs/standards/agentic-attribution.md) for commit messages and PRs.
7. **Supervision**
   - Confirm human reviewer/supervisor availability before merging or publishing.

## Operational Guidelines

- **Quality First**: Always run `make check-all` before commits. Analyze all outputs; resolve process failures (e.g., Makefile issues) before code fixes. Ensure code quality, compliance, and reliability for enterprise-scale systems.
- **Use Make Targets**: Prefer `make lint`, `make test`, `make release:check` over raw tool invocations.
- **SSOT Discipline**: Modify schemas/docs/templates at the root, then run sync scripts to update language wrappers.
- **DO NOT Edit Synced Files**: Never manually edit files in `lang/*/docs/`, `lang/*/schemas/`, or `lang/*/config/` that are synced from root. Only edit SSOT sources at root, then run `make sync` or `bun run sync:to-lang`. Language-specific code files (`.go`, `.ts`, `.py`) in `lang/` are the exception and should be edited directly.
- **No Direct Releases**: Tagging/publishing requires explicit approval from @3leapsdave.
- **Planning Files**: Remain in `.plans/` (gitignored). Do not commit ad-hoc notes.
- **Secrets**: Never store secrets in repo. See `REPOSITORY_SAFETY_PROTOCOLS.md` for guidance.
- **Repository Operations**: Follow commit and push quality standards defined in `docs/standards/repository-safety-framework.md`. Always verify operation results with `git status` before declaring completion.
